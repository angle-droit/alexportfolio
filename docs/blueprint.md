## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#B5B5DC) to create a modern yet approachable feel. Inspired by sophistication, this offers a calm backdrop, in alignment with glassmorphism and lightness, without using blue directly.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F4) with low saturation provides a clean base.
- Accent color: Pale violet (#D8B4FE). Its brighter appearance will help to highlight calls to action and important details.
- Clean, sans-serif font for headings and body text.
- Use subtle, minimalist icons for navigation and skill representation.
- Whitespace and carefully placed elements to enhance the airy feel.
- Gentle transitions and hover effects to enhance the user experience.
